Hello!

For you to use this code you have to do the following:
a) Create a txt file with words (one per line, all in lower case)
   An example of such file is available under the name "mots_pendu.txt"
   You can create your own list though
b) Make sure to save the aforementioned txt file in the same directory as the code
   The code will ask you for the name of the txt file
   It can be anything as long as it is a .txt
C) Download the code & Run the Game!
   NOTE: By default, the user/player have 6 attemps
   If desired, you can chance such value inside the function "Gameplay"
D) Have fun while playing!
