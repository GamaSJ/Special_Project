# Special_Project

This depository contains a Py code that aims to minimise the distance between two sets of 3D coordinates. Description of the files as follow:

A)main - calls up the different modules


B)MInimisation 
  datasets_call - gets data from file
  gradient_descent - coded algo
  initial_condition - reference initial values
  distances_evol - evolution of distances 
  offset_direction - offset direction
  optimised_condition - computes solution found
  minimise_BFGS- scipy - robust comparison


C)VV - verification & validation using scipy
   vv_shift_BFGS
   vv_shift_CF

D) data comparison & manipulation
   cases_comparison - compares cases
   data_update - feeds databas   
   points_stats


Dummy files with data for test samples are included in this depositoty
